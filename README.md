The whole system makes use of the camera of the system to take the gesture input from the user. The executable file of the system launches the camera and opens up a screen displaying the cameraâ€™s point of view of the user. It will allow the user to estimate the workable area within which the system can take gestures as input.
Once the camera is launched, the system is ready for taking gestures as input. The hand landmarks can be observed on both hands if they are put in front of camera (stretched out).
When the mouse is not to be used but the hand is in front of the camera, the neutral gesture can be used (stretched-out hand).

The following getsure are used to carryout the specified mouse functions :

1.	Cursor Movement : It uses the victory gesture to activate the cursor movement and the movement of the hand moves the cursor.

2.	Left Click: This is done by using the victory gesture and then folding the index finger to perform the left click.

3.	Right Click: This is done by using the victory gesture and then folding the middle finger to perform the left click.

4.	Double Click: This is done by using the victory gesture and then joining the index and the middle finger together to perform the left click.

5.	Drag and Drop: This is done by using the cursor movement to go onto the item to be dragged and then creating the fist getsure to select the item. Then the fist should be moved to drag the item accordingly and the fist is released into any other getsure to complete the drag and drop function.

6.	Multiple Item Selection: Similar to Drag and Drop, multiple item selection can be done by making a fist and then dragging the mouse to create selection box and select multiple items.

These mouse functions combined allows the user to perform mouse opereration upto a huge extent. However, there is scope for more functions to be introduced which could make the screen navigation easier like separate functions for scrolling and other important fuctions like brightness and volume control.
